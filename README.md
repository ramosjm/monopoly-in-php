# monopoly-in-php
Wanted to try this again using PHP and XAMPP.
Why? I use PHP for work and need more practice. Otherwise I would not recommend doing this...


##MVP:

- Must be able to choose 2-4 players
- Must have 40 all tiles present (properties, utilities, transport, tax, chance and community chest)
- Store tiles in PHPMyadmin database.
- Must be able to render the board (Using the info from the db)
- Players must be able to roll (a random number) 
- Players must be able to move around the board
- Players must be able to purchase tiles (tiles cannot be held by multiple players)
- Players will receive money whenever they pass go
- Players cannot have negative money

##Extenstions:

- Players will lose money if landed on tax
- Players will will pay rent when landing on another players property
- Implement houses and hotels
- Imprement rent scaling for houses and hotels
- Implement go to jail mechanism
- Implement community chest cards (This will most likely escalate into a big project)
- Implement chance cards (So will this...)
